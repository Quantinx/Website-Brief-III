          <p>
            he show was launched by ABC in 1987 and, despite reviews dismissing
            the show as mediocre, was a hit with American audiences. For much of
            the late 80s-early 90s, Horsin' Around was a major success, to the
            point of regular guest appearances from various celebrities and
            major figures of the time including wrestler Hulk Hogan, baseball
            player Jose Canseco, supermodel Cindy Crawfish, actress Erika
            Eleniak, O.J. Simpson defense attorney Barry Scheck, and even former
            first lady Nancy Reagan. Horsin' Around was also rather progressive
            for the time, as there are episodes that attempt to touch upon
            social issues such as racism, drug use, and the Armenian Genocide.
            Despite this, the show also occasionally included anti-Semitic
            humor, as observed in the first Christmas special. By the early-mid
            1990s, the show began to decline with the debut of rival sitcom Mr.
            Peanutbutter's House, which went on to be even more successful than
            Horsin' Around despite being a blatant ripoff and having worse
            reviews.

            "The show, which is set in Omro, Wisconsin, offers a heartwarming
            and often comedic glimpse into the life of a young bachelor horse,
            affectionately referred to as simply "The Horse." His world takes an
            unexpected turn when he finds himself agreeing to take on the role
            of a guardian for three human children. This unique premise forms
            the foundation of the series, as The Horse embarks on a journey of
            self-discovery and personal growth, reevaluating his priorities and
            learning valuable life lessons along the way. With its charming and
            endearing characters, the show combines elements of humor, warmth,
            and relatability, making it a delightful and engaging story for
            audiences of all ages."
